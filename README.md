This repository is for the Website Project, course: Internet Business Technologies within Georgetown's MBA

The intent is to create a simple way to manage used furniture on sale, an online garage sale.

Not only it is to create a space not relying on social media or on a old-school pdf file, but also to contextualize the garage sale with the family situation. In this case, all the furniture is in good shape, the move is only due to personal reasons.

The main page shows all the items. However by navegating using the upper bar you can see different sections like Living & Kitchen and Bedroom.

The "Place Bid" button puts the user directly in contact with the seller so they can negotiate.
